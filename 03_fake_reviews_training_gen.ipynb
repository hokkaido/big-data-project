    "For training we use [OpenNMT-py](http://opennmt.net/OpenNMT-py/) which is based on PyTorch. This is a run-of-the mill Seq2Seq library that is traditionally used for neural machine translation.\n",

    "I have forked their repository and adapted the code to incorporate ideas from [Stay On-Topic: Generating\n",
    "Context-specific Fake Restaurant Reviews](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.02400.pdf)\n",

    "Namely, during generation (beam-search) some words of the vocabulary will be randomly penalized, on top of that, recurring words will be penalized as well. I've also adapted the `-ignore_when_blocking` parameter from OpenNMT to reduce the penalty for certain 'anchor' words. Unlike the paper, this reduced penalty is only active after the first step and not for step 0.\n",
